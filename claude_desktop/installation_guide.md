# ARC Phase 3: Claude Desktop Integration Setup

## ðŸŽ¯ **Overview**

Phase 3 completes your ARC system with production-ready Claude Desktop integration that leverages all enhanced capabilities:
- **12 specialized MCP tools** for comprehensive knowledge access
- **Enhanced entity extraction** with sophisticated AI disambiguation and relationship inference
- **Multi-modal search** across documents, entities, and relationships
- **Sophisticated prompting** for optimal AI assistance

## ðŸ“‹ **Prerequisites**

Before starting Phase 3:
- âœ… Phase 1 & 2 completed (enhanced ARC system working)
- âœ… Data imported with enhanced extraction and relationship inference
- âœ… MCP server tested and functional
- âœ… Claude Desktop app installed

## ðŸš€ **Installation Steps**

### **Step 1: Copy Configuration Files**

Copy the Claude Desktop configuration to your system:

```bash
# Navigate to your ARC directory
cd /Users/dbdave/work/arc

# Create Claude Desktop config directory (if not exists)
mkdir -p ~/.config/claude-desktop

# Copy the ARC configuration
cp claude_desktop/claude_desktop_config.json ~/.config/claude-desktop/claude_desktop_config.json
```

### **Step 2: Update Configuration Paths**

Edit the configuration file to match your system:

```bash
# Open the config file
nano ~/.config/claude-desktop/claude_desktop_config.json

# Update the path in the "args" section:
"args": [
  "/YOUR_ACTUAL_PATH/work/arc/tools/arc_mcp_server.py"
]

# Update the PYTHONPATH in the "env" section:
"env": {
  "PYTHONPATH": "/YOUR_ACTUAL_PATH/work/arc/tools:/YOUR_ACTUAL_PATH/work/arc",
  "ARC_CONFIG_PATH": "/YOUR_ACTUAL_PATH/work/arc/.env"
}
```

### **Step 3: Verify MCP Server**

Test that your MCP server is working correctly:

```bash
cd /Users/dbdave/work/arc/tools
python test_mcp_server.py
```

Expected output:
```
âœ… Configuration loaded successfully
âœ… Database manager initialized successfully  
âœ… Neo4j connection successful
âœ… ChromaDB connection successful - X collections found
ðŸŽ‰ ARC MCP Server validation complete - all systems ready!
```

### **Step 4: Test Claude Desktop Integration**

1. **Restart Claude Desktop** completely (quit and reopen)

2. **Check MCP Connection**: In a new Claude conversation, you should see the ARC server connected in the interface

3. **Test Basic Functionality**: Try a simple query:
   ```
   Search for entities in the ARC system
   ```

4. **Verify Tool Access**: Confirm Claude can access all 12 ARC tools:
   - search_entities
   - semantic_search
   - enhanced_hybrid_search
   - get_entity_relationships
   - find_connection_path
   - entity_context_search
   - entity_centric_search
   - relationship_search
   - temporal_search
   - enhanced_temporal_search
   - meeting_preparation
   - get_document

## ðŸŽ¯ **Testing Your Setup**

### **Basic Functionality Test**
```
"Find information about recent product discussions"
```
Expected: Claude uses enhanced_hybrid_search or semantic_search to find relevant documents.

### **Entity Discovery Test**
```
"Tell me about [a person in your organization]"
```
Expected: Claude uses search_entities â†’ entity_context_search â†’ get_entity_relationships for comprehensive results.

### **Relationship Analysis Test**
```
"How are [Person A] and [Person B] connected?"
```
Expected: Claude uses find_connection_path and provides relationship mapping.

### **Meeting Preparation Test**
```
"Prepare me for a meeting with [Person] about [Topic]"
```
Expected: Claude uses meeting_preparation + supporting tools for comprehensive context.

## ðŸ”§ **Troubleshooting**

### **MCP Server Not Starting**
```bash
# Check Python path and dependencies
cd /Users/dbdave/work/arc/tools
python -c "import arc_mcp_server; print('Import successful')"

# Check environment variables
echo $PYTHONPATH
cat /Users/dbdave/work/arc/.env
```

### **Database Connection Issues**
```bash
# Test database connections
cd /Users/dbdave/work/arc/tools
python -c "
from arc_core import get_db_manager
db = get_db_manager()
print('Neo4j:', db.neo4j.verify_connectivity())
print('ChromaDB collections:', len(db.chromadb.list_collections()))
"
```

### **Tool Access Problems**
- Verify all tools are in the `alwaysAllow` list in claude_desktop_config.json
- Restart Claude Desktop after configuration changes
- Check Claude Desktop's MCP connection status

### **Performance Issues**
```bash
# Check system resources and database statistics
cd /Users/dbdave/work/arc/tools
python arc_query.py stats
```

## ðŸ“Š **Success Metrics**

- Query "Recent discussions about [topic]" for staying current

### **Power User Techniques**
- Combine multiple question types in single queries
- Use temporal qualifiers ("last quarter", "recent", "since January")
- Include role/team context for better entity disambiguation
- Ask follow-up questions to drill deeper into interesting results

### **Collaboration Benefits**
- Share ARC insights in team discussions
- Use relationship mapping for cross-functional projects
