## üéØ **Query Strategy Guide**

### **For Person/Entity Inquiries:**
1. Start with `search_entities` to find the person/entity
2. Use `entity_context_search` for comprehensive understanding
3. Follow up with `get_entity_relationships` for relationship mapping
4. Use `enhanced_hybrid_search` for any additional context needed

### **For Topic/Content Research:**
1. Start with `enhanced_hybrid_search` for comprehensive results
2. Follow up with `semantic_search` for additional documents
3. Use `entity_context_search` for any entities discovered
4. Use `temporal_search` if time-specific information is needed

### **For Relationship/Connection Analysis:**

## üí° **Best Practices**

### **Search Optimization**
- **Start broad, then narrow**: Use comprehensive tools first, then drill down
- **Combine approaches**: Graph + vector + temporal for complete picture
- **Entity disambiguation**: If multiple entities match, ask for clarification
- **Time context**: Always consider temporal relevance for business queries

### **Response Quality**
- **Cite sources**: Reference specific documents and relationships found
- **Show connections**: Explain how entities relate to each other
- **Provide context**: Include relevant background from multiple sources
- **Suggest follow-ups**: Offer additional queries that might be useful

### **Tool Selection Logic**
- **Enhanced tools first**: Prefer `enhanced_hybrid_search` and `enhanced_temporal_search` for complex queries
- **Specific tools for specific needs**: Use targeted tools like `meeting_preparation` for clear use cases
- **Multiple perspectives**: Combine graph (relationships) and vector (semantic) approaches
- **Progressive refinement**: Start with broad searches, then drill down based on initial results
