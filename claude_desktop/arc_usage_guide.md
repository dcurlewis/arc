```

## ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tips for Maximum Value**

### **Tool Combination Strategies**

**The "Full Context" Pattern:**
1. Start with `enhanced_hybrid_search` for comprehensive discovery
2. Use `search_entities` to identify key people/organizations
3. Apply `entity_context_search` for deep dives on key entities
4. Use `get_entity_relationships` to understand the network
5. Add `temporal_search` for timeline context

**The "Meeting Prep" Pattern:**
1. Use `meeting_preparation` with attendee names
2. Follow with `entity_context_search` for each key participant
3. Add `enhanced_hybrid_search` for topic-specific preparation
4. Use `temporal_search` for recent relevant developments

**The "Strategic Analysis" Pattern:**
1. Use `enhanced_temporal_search` for historical context
2. Apply `semantic_search` for current thinking
3. Use `search_entities` + `get_entity_relationships` for stakeholder mapping
4. Combine with `enhanced_hybrid_search` for comprehensive view

### **Query Optimization**

**For People Queries:**
- Use full names when possible, but the system handles aliases
- Combine role/title information: "VP of Engineering" 
- Include context: "engineers working on platform"

**For Topic Queries:**
- Use natural language: "machine learning initiatives"
- Include synonyms: "AI/ML projects and research"
- Add temporal context: "recent product strategy discussions"

**For Relationship Queries:**
- Be specific about relationship types: "reporting relationships"
- Use directional language: "who reports to X" vs "who does X report to"
- Include project context: "collaboration on platform redesign"

### **Time-Based Queries**
```
Specific periods: "Q4 2024 planning discussions"
Recent context: "last 30 days of updates on [Project]"
Evolution tracking: "how [Strategy] evolved from 2023 to now"
Trend analysis: "increasing mentions of [Topic] over time"
```

### **Entity Disambiguation**
```
When multiple matches exist:
"John Smith in Engineering" (not "John Smith in Sales")
"Platform team (not iOS platform team)"
"Q4 planning (not Q4 results)"
```

## ðŸ”„ **Workflow Templates**

### **New Team Member Onboarding**
```
1. "Find key people [New Hire] should know in [Department]"
2. "Recent projects and initiatives in [Team/Department]"  
3. "Important context about [Team's] current priorities"
4. "Who are [New Hire's] key collaborators based on role?"
```

### **Project Kickoff Research**
```
1. "Previous similar projects and their outcomes"
2. "Key stakeholders and decision makers for [Project Area]"
3. "Current thinking and discussions about [Project Topic]"
4. "Dependencies and cross-team relationships relevant to [Project]"
```

### **Strategic Planning Support**
```
1. "Current initiatives and their progress in [Area]"
2. "Key constraints and challenges mentioned recently"
3. "Stakeholder perspectives on [Strategic Topic]"
4. "Historical context and lessons from previous [Strategy Type]"
```

### **Performance Review Preparation**
```
1. "Recent contributions and collaborations by [Person]"
2. "Projects and initiatives [Person] has been involved in"
3. "Feedback and mentions of [Person] in team discussions"
4. "Cross-functional relationships and impact of [Person]"
```

## ðŸ“Š **Understanding Results**

### **Confidence Indicators**
- **High relevance**: Multiple tool results converge on the same information
- **Strong relationships**: Direct connections in the graph database
- **Recent activity**: Temporal clustering of related information
- **Cross-validation**: Vector and graph search agree on importance

### **Result Interpretation**
- **Entity matches**: Exact name matches vs. alias/variation matches
- **Relationship strength**: Direct vs. indirect connections
- **Document relevance**: Semantic similarity scores and metadata
- **Temporal relevance**: Recency vs. historical significance

### **Follow-up Opportunities**
Look for:
- **Incomplete relationship paths** â†’ Use deeper relationship exploration
- **Interesting entity mentions** â†’ Dive deeper with entity_context_search
- **Time gaps in results** â†’ Use temporal_search to fill gaps
- **Cross-functional implications** â†’ Explore broader relationship networks
